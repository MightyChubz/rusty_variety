# Rusty Variety
Rusty Variety is a program orginally made as an alternative to Variety. If you don't mind lossing the effects and the clock, and some of the smaller features like how Variety remembers your last used wallpaper, then this program will work well for you. All it does is take the input directory, and looks for how long to wait, and it will randomly change wallpaper after a set amount of time.
